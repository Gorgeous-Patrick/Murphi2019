This is simply a home for the classic Murphi model checking tool from David Dill's Stanford group.

The code is based on version 3.1, which seems to be the baseline version before it branches into more specialized variants.

If the dates in the code are to be believed then it was last updated in 1999 (20 years ago).

In order to compile, I had to change a few of the headers and adjust namespaces, but remarkably it seems to still run.

I don't have much time for this, but I'd like to whittle away at some of the compiler warnings and possibly set up some simple regression tests.

Collaboration is always welcome.
